I was interviewed by [Sam Newman](https://samnewman.io) at the SoundCloud office as part of his Magpie Talk Show podcast series.

We mainly talked about Zipkin and Distributed Tracing but also about how the team I am part of at SoundCloud supports the engineering organisation with libraries and tools to build microservices.
