# Professional

My current role is Director of Engineering, Content at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) where I'm leading a diverse team.

As a music and podcast fan being able to use my software engineering and leadership skills for a company like SoundCloud that supports [creators](https://creators.soundcloud.com) by letting them connect with fans directly, [allowing them to make money](https://creators.soundcloud.com/monetization) and [distribute to other music services](https://blog.soundcloud.com/2019/02/19/beta-release-of-soundcloud-premier-distribution/) is very rewarding. 

My aim as a leader is to create an environment and conditions so the team can do its best work.
This includes making sure there is trust, creating clarity, listening, supporting and growing the team and the individuals and making sure the team is empowered to make decisions and drive change.

I have experience with hiring and onboarding team members. I helped growing careers, assisted moving people into the job of their choice, dealt with conflicts and helped getting teams through organisational changes. Since recently I have some experience with managing other managers. 

Before stepping into the management path I worked as a Software Engineer and Software Architect for many years. For more details about my career path, see [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kristof-adriaenssens-8a481619).

My most impactful publicly available work is probably a Java library called [Brave][1].  Brave is a Distributed Tracing library. It became part of [OpenZipkin](../2015-07-17-brave-moved-to-openzipkin/) in 2015 and is integrated in the [Spring framework](https://spring.io) as part of [Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/). 


# Personal

I like swimming, cooking, listening to music, reading, meeting friends, walking or resting in nature.

Several occurrences in recent years like my move to Berlin, Germany in 2014, the 'refugee crisis', brexit, the election of Trump and [The Age of Sustainable Development Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainable-development) has made me more conscious about the need for a more inclusive, compassionate and sustainable future with respect for our planetary boundaries.  

That's why I'm interested in joining organisations and teams that contribute to reaching one or more of the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org) or work in the field of Social Innovation.  Having a positive impact in peoples lives and for our society is important for me.
