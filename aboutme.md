# Professional


15+ years of experience as a Software Engineer. Moved into an Engineering Manager position in 2016 and in a Director role in 2019. 

I’m an engineering leader who likes to work at the intersection of Technology, Product and Delivery. I have a deep interest in Agile methodologies and DevOps / DevSecOps and I love to work on products that matter and serve people’s needs.

I like building and growing a team and enable them to do their best work. This includes making sure there is trust, creating clarity, and supporting and help growing the team and the individuals. I want to empower the team so they can make decisions, drive change and deliver value.

I'm moving from Berlin, Germany back to [Ghent, Belgium](https://visit.gent.be/en) in August 2020 and I have found a new opportunity that I'm really excited about.  Previously working at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) and [Tomtom](https://www.tomtom.com).

As a Software Engineer, my most impactful publicly available work is probably a Java library called [Brave][1].  Brave is a Distributed Tracing library. It became part of [OpenZipkin](../2015-07-17-brave-moved-to-openzipkin/) in 2015 and is integrated in the [Spring framework](https://spring.io) as part of [Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/). If you're interested to know more you can read [the story about OpenZipkin's 5th year anniversary](https://github.com/openzipkin/openzipkin.github.io/wiki/OpenZipkin's-5-year-anniversary).


# Personal

I like swimming, cooking, listening to music, reading, meeting friends, photography and walking or resting in nature.
