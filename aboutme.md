# Professional


Software Engineer currently working at [Olympus Mobility](https://www.olympus-mobility.be/en/). In the past I've been working at [In The Pocket](https://www.inthepocket.com), [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) and [Tomtom](http://www.tomtom.com) in both individual contributor and leadership roles.

I like working at the intersection of Technology, Product and Delivery and like helping teams so they can to do their best work.

I'm an advocate of Agile and Lean principles and like to look and help improve the complete product development process. 

I love to work on products that matter and that serve peopleâ€™s and society's needs.  For more details see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristof-adriaenssens-8a481619/).


# Personal

I like swimming, cooking, listening to music, reading, meeting friends, photography and walking or resting in nature.
