# Professional


Team Lead at [In The Pocket](https://www.inthepocket.com). In the past I've been working at [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) and [Tomtom](http://www.tomtom.com).
I have 15+ years of experience as a Software Engineer and I moved into an Engineering Manager / Team Lead position in 2016.

I like working at the intersection of Technology, Product and Delivery and have an interest in Agile methodologies and DevOps / DevSecOps. I love to work on products that matter and serve peopleâ€™s needs.  For more details see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristof-adriaenssens-8a481619/).


# Personal

I like swimming, cooking, listening to music, reading, meeting friends, photography and walking or resting in nature.
